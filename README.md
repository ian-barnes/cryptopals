# Cryptopals

- Work in progress
- Solutions to the [Cryptopals Crypto Challenges](https://cryptopals.com/)

Note: I've made use of the "hints without spoilers" at
<https://github.com/stripedpajamas/cryptopals-resources>. I have to say I find
some of the problem descriptions quite poorly written and was led astray and
wasted hours going in wrong directions several times until I discovered this
resource.
